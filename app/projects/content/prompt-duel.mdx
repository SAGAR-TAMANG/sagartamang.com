> **"Stop guessing which prompt is better. Duel them and let the data decide."**

I designed, coded, and deployed **PromptDuel** within a single 24-hour sprint on Christmas Day 2025.

## The Problem
When developing AI Agents, small semantic changes in a prompt can lead to drastically different outputs. Tracking this in spreadsheets is messy. You need a way to **blind test** these outputs against each other to get clean, unbiased data.

## The Solution
PromptDuel solves the "vibe check" problem. It is a lightweight, structured environment to evaluate LLM outputs side-by-side.

### Key Features
- **⚖️ Side-by-Side Arena:** A clean, split-screen interface for comparing two text outputs (supports Markdown).
- **🫣 Blind Testing Mode:** Model names are hidden from voters to ensure unbiased feedback.
- **🔗 Instant Sharing:** Generate public, read-only links for clients or team members to cast votes.
- **📊 Analytics Dashboard:** Track vote velocity and win rates visually.
- **🔐 Secure:** Row Level Security (RLS) via Supabase ensures data integrity.

## Tech Stack
I chose a stack focused on speed and reliability:
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router) + Tailwind CSS
- **UI Library:** Shadcn/UI + Lucide Icons
- **Backend/Auth:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + RLS)
- **Visualization:** Recharts
